# Avishka Weerasekara - Portfolio

This is a simple static portfolio for Avishka Weerasekara created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

How to use:
- Replace `assets/profile.svg` with Avishka's profile picture (jpg/png).
 - `assets/Header.jpeg` has been added and used in `index.html` as the profile picture.
 - Javascript is used for reveal animations and requires the browser to support modern features. All elements are visible by default if JS is disabled.
- Replace `assets/Avishka_Weerasekara_CV.pdf` with the real CV file (change path if necessary).
- Update social links in `index.html` to link to real profiles.
- Replace portfolio images and project descriptions with real projects.

Development:
- Live preview: open `index.html` in a web browser.
- For local testing, run a simple static server (Python example):

```powershell
# From this project directory
python -m http.server 5500; # live server at http://localhost:5500
```

Contributions: feel free to adjust colors, layout, and add more projects.
